cocos2d-html5 + JSBinding + cocos2d-x Bluetooth Multiplayer Demo


About:
. A simple demo showing how to add bluetooth multiplayer feature to a cocos2d-html5 game using JSBinding

. The demo uses cocos2d-x 2.2.1 + cocos2d-html5 2.2.1

. The bluetooth is based on GameKit provided by Apple

. The bluetooth OC part is taken from this awesome tutorial serials on raywenderlich's site: <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/12735/how-to-make-a-simple-playing-card-game-with-multiplayer-and-bluetooth-part-1">check out</a>

. The main code flow of the demo: js -> cpp -> oc -> cpp -> js

. The demo is not complelted yet (lacking sending and receiving package)

. I'm bad at OC and haven't used C++ for a few years so there might be bad design pattern or memory management
